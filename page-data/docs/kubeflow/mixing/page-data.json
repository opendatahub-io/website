It is also our goal to provide the capability to mix components from both projects.</p>\n<h4>How to Deploy Components From Both Projects</h4>\n<p>We are maintaining an example KFDef manifest which includes components from both projects. You can find it in <a href=\"https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-manifests/blob/master/kfdef/kfctl_openshift_mix.yaml\">opendatahub-io/manifests</a> repository.</p>\n<p>To use it, simply follow the <a href=\"%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/docs/getting-started/basic-tutorial\">basic tutorial</a>, but instead of the default KFDef manifest, deploy the one linked above:</p>\n<pre><code>oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opendatahub-io/odh-manifests/master/kfdef/kfctl_openshift_mix.yaml\n</code></pre>\n<h4>How Does it Work</h4>\n<p>KFDef manifest allows you to list multiple repository references. This is useful for mixing components from ODH and Kubeflow, but also for <a href=\"%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/docs/administration/installation-customization/customization\">the deployment customization</a>.</p>\n<p>As you can see, we are providing references to <a href=\"https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-manifests/\">odh-manifests</a> repository (as <code>manifests</code>) and to <a href=\"https://github.com/opendatahub-io/manifests/\">manifests</a> repository (as <code>kf-manifests</code>). With these two references in your KFDef, you can simply mix and match components from both of them</p>\n<pre><code>...\n  - kustomizeConfig:\n      repoRef:\n        name: manifests\n        path: odhargo/cluster\n    name: odhargo-cluster\n  - kustomizeConfig:\n      repoRef:\n        name: manifests\n        path: odhargo/odhargo\n    name: odhargo\n  - kustomizeConfig:\n      repoRef:\n        name: kf-manifests\n        path: tf-training/tf-job-crds\n    name: tf-job-crds\n  - kustomizeConfig:\n      repoRef:\n        name: kf-manifests\n        path: tf-training/tf-job-operator\n    name: tf-job-operator\n  repos:\n  - name: kf-manifests\n    uri: https://github.com/opendatahub-io/manifests/tarball/v1.0-branch-openshift  \n  - name: manifests\n    uri: https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-manifests/tarball/master\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see above, there are 2 components mentioned - Argo and TF Job Operator. Argo uses <code>manifests</code> as a source repository and TF Job Operator uses <code>kf-manifests</code>.</p>\n<h3>Verified Components</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Version</th>\n<th>Issues</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/opendatahub-io/manifests/blob/v1.0-branch-openshift/tf-training/\">TF Job</a></td>\n<td>v1</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>{% include next-link.html label=\"AI Library\" url=\"/docs/ai-library.html\" %}</p>"}},"pageContext":{"permalink":"/docs/kubeflow/mixing"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1804438722"]}
